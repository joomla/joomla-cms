<h1>What is this directory?</h1>

<p>In this directory, Akeeba Backup and Akeeba Solo store the optional filters (Optional Filters in the Configuration
    page). Unlike regular filters which are always loaded, optional filters are only loaded when the user chooses to
    enable them. Each filter consists of two files: <var>filtername</var>.ini and <var>filtername</var>.php. The former
    contains the filter-specific configuration options and the later contains the actual filter code.</p>

<p>
    If you want to create new optional filters, put them in here. Do note that the INI file must always contain a
    boolean key named core.filters.<var>filtername</var>.enabled which controls the loading of this particular filter.
</p>

<p>
    Optional filters are always named Akeeba\Engine\Filter\Stack\Stack<var>Filtername</var> so that the autoloader can
    find them. For the same reason their filename must be Stack<var>Filtername</var>.php   Please watch out for the
    letter case in the names, it's important.
