QUICKTIPTEXT=When a User edits a file, Mambo changes its status to, "Checked Out". Thereafter the file is locked and only the User who has "checked it out" has permission to work with it. This is a security feature that prevents two Users from editing a document at the same time, thus preventing loss of data upon saving.
