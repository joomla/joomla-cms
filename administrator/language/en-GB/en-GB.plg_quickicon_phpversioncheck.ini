PLG_QUICKICON_PHPVERSIONCHECK_SECURITY_ONLY="Your PHP version, %1$s, is only receiving security fixes at this time from the PHP project. This means your PHP version will soon no longer be supported. We recommend planning to upgrade to a newer PHP version before it reaches end of support on %2$s. Joomla will be faster and more secure if you upgrade to a newer PHP version (PHP 7.x is recommended). Please contact your host for upgrade instructions."

PLG_QUICKICON_PHPVERSIONCHECK_UNSUPPORTED="We have detected that your server is using PHP %1$s which is obsolete and no longer receives official security updates by its developers. The Joomla project recommends upgrading your site to PHP %2$s or later which will receive security updates at least until %3$s. Please ask your host to make PHP %2$s or a later version the default version for your site. If your host is already PHP %2$s ready please enable PHP %2$s on your site's root and 'administrator' directories – typically you can do this yourself through a tool in your hosting control panel, but it's best to ask your host if you are unsure."
PLG_QUICKICON_PHPVERSIONCHECK_XML_DESCRIPTION="Checks the support status of your installation's PHP version and raises a warning if not fully supported."
