TPL_STRAPPED_XML_DESCRIPTION="<p>Strapped (short for Bootstrapped)  is the foundation and base for the total reworking of Joomla's markup standards and best practices. Joomla developers have always pushed the boundaries of available UI in the Joomla frontend and backend.  The JUI would be an ongoing effort to deliver a library of UI elements to help devs rapidly deploy interfaces and layouts. As new UI elements emerge, the JUI can improve in iterations instead of forcing developers to innovate outside Joomla, which can result in non-standard layouts and disjointed workflows. Think of a UI kit built specifically for Joomla, similar to something like Twitter's Bootstrap Framework.</p><p>Strapped and the JUI are the babies of the <a href=\"http://ux.joomla.org/\">JUX (Joomla eXperience Project)</a>."
