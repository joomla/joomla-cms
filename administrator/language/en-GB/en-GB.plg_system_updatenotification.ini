If none of the listed emails belogns to Super Users, or if it's left blank, all Super Users of this site will receive the update notification email."
PLG_SYSTEM_UPDATENOTIFICATION_LANGUAGE_OVERRIDE_LBL="Email language"
PLG_SYSTEM_UPDATENOTIFICATION_LANGUAGE_OVERRIDE_DESC="If you choose Auto (default), the update notification email to Super Users will be in the logged in user's front-end language at the time the plugin is triggered. In multi-language sites this can create confusion: the user's language may be one the Super User receiving the email doesn't speak. By selecting a language here you are forcing the update notification emails to be sent in this specific language."
