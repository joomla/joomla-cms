Using this feature you can upload extension files directly to your web server using some other means such as FTP or SFTP and place those extension files into the appropriate directory. <br />You can then use the discover feature to find the newly uploaded extension and activate it in your Joomla! installation. <br />Using the discover operation you can also discover and install multiple extensions at the same time."

COM_INSTALLER_MSG_WARNINGS_JOOMLATMPNOTSETDESC="The Joomla! temporary directory is where Joomla! copies an extension, extracts the extension and the files are copied into the correct directories. If this configuration is not set in configuration.php ($tmp_path) then you won't be able to upload extensions. Create a directory to enable Joomla! to write to the directory to fix the issue."
COM_INSTALLER_MSG_WARNINGS_JOOMLATMPNOTWRITEABLE="Joomla temporary directory not writable or does not exist"
COM_INSTALLER_MSG_WARNINGS_JOOMLATMPNOTWRITEABLEDESC="The Joomla temporary directory is not writeable by the Joomla! instance, or may not exist, which may cause issues when attempting to upload extensions to Joomla!. If you are having issues uploading extensions, make sure the directory defined in your configuration.php exists or check the '%s' and set it to be writeable and see if this fixes the issue."

The post_max_size variable will take precedence here and block requests larger than it. This is generally a server misconfiguration when trying to increase upload sizes. Please increase the upload_max_filesize to at least match the post_max_size variable or vice versa"
COM_INSTALLER_MSG_WARNINGS_NONE="No warnings detected"
COM_INSTALLER_MSG_WARNINGS_PHPUPLOADNOTSET="The PHP temporary directory is not set"
COM_INSTALLER_MSG_WARNINGS_PHPUPLOADNOTSETDESC="The PHP temporary directory is the directory that PHP uses to store an uploaded file before Joomla! can access this file. Whilst the directory not being set isn't always a problem, if you are having issues with manifest files not being detected or uploaded files not being detected, setting this in your php.ini file might fix the issue."
