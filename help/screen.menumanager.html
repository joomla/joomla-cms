<h1>Menu Manager</h1>


<p align="right">-- Draft Version 4.5.3<br /></p>&quot;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Menus</span>&quot; in Joomla! are groups of navigational links to sections, categories, content items, components or external pages. These links are called 'Menu Items'.<br /><br />Each menu must have an identification name which is only used internally by Mambo.<br />A menu only becomes visible on a site if it has a published mod_mainmenu module which references it. A menu may have multiple mod_mainmmenu modules referencing it.<br /><h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Toolbar Icons</span></h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Copy: </span>Click the radio button next to the Menu Name you want to copy.
Then, click the ‘Copy’ icon in the toolbar. This will duplicate the
menu. You may copy any of your menus. Copying will create a new Menu
Name, containing the same Menu Items as the menu copied, associated to
a new Menu Module. <br /><br />A ‘Copy Page’ will display, with the same
choices as in Create New Menu . It will also state the name of the Menu
being copied, and a list of the Menu Items associated to the menu being
copied. Fill in the fields as in Create New Menu.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Delete:&nbsp;</span> Click the radio button next to the Menu Name you want to
delete. Then, click the ‘Delete’ icon in the toolbar. This will delete
the Menu. A &quot;Delete Menu : Name-of-the-menu&quot; page will display. It
shows the Module(s) to be deleted (the mod_mainmenu modules associated
to this Menu) and the Menu Items to be deleted. Click the Delete Icon
surrounded by a dotted line. This will delete this Menu, ALL its Menu
Items and ALL the Modules associated with it. A Javascript alert popup
box gives you the choice to &quot;OK&quot; or to &quot;Cancel&quot; this action. <br /><span style="font-style: italic;">NOTE: Deleted Menus cannot be recovered from the Trash Manager!<br /><br /></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Edit:&nbsp;</span> Click the radio button next to the Menu Name you want to edit.&nbsp;
Then, click the &quot;Edit&quot; icon which will take you to the Editing page. You may change there the name of the Menu.<br /><br style="font-weight: bold;" /><span style="font-weight: bold;">New:</span> Click this icon to create a new Menu. You will access the &quot;New Menu&quot; window.<br /><br />Type a Menu Name. This is the identification name used by Joomla! to identify this menu within the code ; it must be unique.&nbsp; It is recommended to use no space within this name. For example, in the core Joomla! the User Menu’s Menu Name is ‘usermenu’ and the Main Menu’s Menu Name is ‘mainmenu’.&nbsp; Type a Module Title. This is the name given to the new mod_mainmenu module which is automatically created when you save this menu. It is also the Name of the menu as it will appear on the page if you choose to show it (this may be changed when editing the module). In the example described above these are ‘User Menu’ and ‘Main Menu’. Click the ‘Save’ icon. Your new menu appears in the Menu Manager list.<br /><br /><a href="index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=604&Itemid=116">Help: User Menu</a><br /><br /><a href="http://help.mamboserver.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=439">Help: Main Menu / Home Page</a><br /><br /><h2>JS Tree</h2>This navigation tree provides shortcuts to access various aspects of the Administration related to Menus.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Menu Manager</span>.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Menus</span> which are defined on the site.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Trash</span> with the number of Items it contains.<br /><h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Columns descriptions</span></h2>The headings give information on the following functions :<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Menu Name:</span>&nbsp; This is the name that is given to the menu by default, or the name you gave to that menu. You may click on this Name to edit it.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Menu Items:&nbsp;</span> Click the ‘Edit’ icon in this column to add or edit Menu Items associated with a menu. Or alternatively go to &quot;Menu-&gt;the-menu-you-choose-to-edit&quot;. A &quot;Menu Manager [the-menu-you-choose-to-edit]&quot; window will display with a list of all Menu Items associated to this Menu.<br /><br />NumPublished:-&nbsp; This is the number of Menu Items published.<br /><br />Num Unpublished: This is the the number of Menu Items unpublished.<br /><br />Num Trash: This is the number of Menu Items in the Trash Manager.<br /><br />Num Modules: This is the number of menu modules associated to the Menu Name.<br /><br />Other function available below the list: <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Display #:</span> You may alter the number of rows displayed in the list.<br /><span style="font-style: italic;">NOTE:

are in the Administator back-end. A default value for the list length
is also configurable in Global Configuration. </span><br />
