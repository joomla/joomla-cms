LOADJ15TITLE=Load local Joomla! 1.5 SQL script
LOADSAMPLEORMIGRATE=Load Sample Data, Restore, or Migrate Backed Up Content
LOADSQLINSTRUCTIONS1=<strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: It is recommended that beginners should install the default sample data. This requires selecting the option and clicking on the button before moving to next stage.
LOADSQLINSTRUCTIONS2=Before leaving the installation you can populate the site database with data.There are three options to do this:
LOADSQLINSTRUCTIONS3=<strong>1. Default Sample Data</strong> can be inserted - To do this select the first option and click the Install Sample Data button.
LOADSQLINSTRUCTIONS4=<strong>2.a Joomla! 1.5 Compatible SQL Script File</strong> can be uploaded from local host and executed on the site. This could be for installing localised sample data or restoring a Joomla! 1.5 backup. The script should have the correct table prefixes, should be in utf-8 encoding and should comply with Joomla! 1.5 database schema.
LOADSQLINSTRUCTIONS5=<strong>2.b Migration of content from previous versions</strong>. Checking the "Joomla! 1.0 Migration Script" option enables support for migration of older version dumps to the new Joomla! 1.5 site. Required conversions are performed 'on-the-fly'. The script file can be created automatically on the old site by the 'com_migrator' Component or created manually according to the instructions <a href="http://dev.joomla.org/component/option,com_jd-wp/Itemid,33/p,107/" target="_blank">here</a>.
LOADSQLINSTRUCTIONS6=The Upload facility supports uncompressed SQL script files, Zip packed script files and gz packed script files. Packed files may contain only a single SQL script file. You may tick the "I have already uploaded the migration script" option if you find the file is too big to handle (memory and time limit errors) and upload the file in the "/installation/sql/migration/" called "migrate.sql" (no compression allowed).

STEPS=Steps
TABLE PREFIX=Table Prefix
TIPBACKUP=Any existing backup tables from former Joomla! installations will be replaced
TIPCOLLATIONNONUTF=<p>This version of MySQL does not have UTF-8 support which is the required encoding.</p><p>It is recommended that you upgrade your database to a version newer than 4.1.2. If this is not possible, Joomla! will store utf-8 encoded content in your existing database in a backward compatibility mode. Collation selection is not possible in this mode and a default collation will be used.</p>
TIPCOLLATIONUTF=<p>This version of MySQL includes UTF-8 support which is the required encoding.</p><p>Choose a collation from the list. If none appears for your language, that is because the default collation <em>utf8_general_ci</em> is suitable.</p>
TIPCONFSTEPS=<p>Enter your e-mail address, this will be the e-mail address of the site\n        Super Administrator. If you are migrating you can ignore this section as your current settings will be automatically migrated.</p>
TIPDATABASE=Some hosts allow only a certain DB name per site. Use table prefix in this case for distinct Joomla! sites.
TIPDATABASESTEPS=<p>Setting up Joomla! to run on your server involves 4 simple steps...</p>	<p>In this Database Configuration Step:</p><p>Select the Type of Database from the drop down list. This will generally be <strong>mysql</strong>.</p>	<p>Enter the hostname of the server Joomla! is to be installed on.</p>\n		<p>Enter the MySQL username, password, and database name you wish to use with Joomla!. These must already exist for the database you are going to use.</p>	<p>Enter a prefix to be used by tables for this Joomla! installation.</p><p> Select how to handle existing tables from a previous installation.</p>
TIPFTPCONFSTEPS=<p>Due to file system permission restrictions and PHP Safe Mode restrictions in order that all users can utilize the Joomla! installers an FTP layer exists to handle file system manipulation.<br/><br/>Enter an FTP Username and Password with access to the Joomla! root directory, this will be the FTP Account that handles all file system operations when Joomla! requires FTP access to complete a task.<br /><br/>For security reasons, it is best if a separate FTP User Account is created with access only to the Joomla! installation and not the whole web server if this option is available to you.</p>
TIPHOST=This is usually <strong>localhost</strong> or a host name provided by the hoster
TIPINSTALLDEFAULT=Installing this is strongly recommended for beginners. It will install default sample content that is included in the Joomla! installation package.
TIPLOADMIGRATION=The migration script needs to be created on the old site by the com_migrator tool or created manually to conform. Enter the table prefix of the old site and enter the encoding used in old site (_ISO setting in language file or as seen in browser info/encoding/source).
TIPUPLOADED=I have already uploaded the migration script to the server (e.g. via FTP/SCP)
TIPMIGRATION=This script is a Joomla! 1.0 migration script.
TIPLOADSQL=Joomla! 1.5 Migration SQL scripts need to be Joomla 1.5 compatible and should have the appropriate table prefix.
TIPPASSWORD=For site security using a password for the MySQL account is mandatory
TIPPERMS=In order for Joomla! to function\ncorrectly it needs to be able to access or write to certain files\nor directories. If you see Unwritable you need to change the\npermissions on the file or directory to allow Joomla!\nto write to it.
TIPPREFIX=Do not use 'bak_' since this is used for backup tables
TIPPREINSTALL=If any of these items are set to No (highlighted in red) your system does not match the minimum requirements necessary. Please take the appropriate actions to correct the errors. Failure to do so could lead to your Joomla! installation not functioning correctly.
TIPRECOMSETTINGS=These settings are recommended for PHP in order to ensure full compatibility with Joomla!<br />\nHowever, Joomla! will still operate if your settings do not quite match the recommended.
