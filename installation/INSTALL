REQUIREMENTS
------------

First you must have the base environment for Joomla.
We have thoroughly tested Joomla! on: Linux, Free BSD, Mac OS X and Windows.
Linux or one of the BSD's are recommended, but anything else that can run 
a supported PHP version, a supported database and a supported web server listed
in the Technical Requirements at https://downloads.joomla.org/technical-requirements
should do it.


SERVER CONFIGURATION
--------------------

You MUST ensure that PHP has been compiled with support for MySQL (or the database
you are using) and Zlib in order to successfully run Joomla.

While we have reports that Joomla! works on IIS server we recommend Apache
for running Joomla! on Windows.


OPTIONAL COMPONENTS
-------------------

If you want support for SEF (Search Engine Friendly) URLs using the Apache web server
you'll need mod_rewrite and the ability to use local .htaccess files. If you are using
the IIS web server you'll need the ability to use local web.config.txt files


INSTALLATION
------------

1. DOWNLOAD Joomla

	You can obtain the latest Joomla! release from:
		https://downloads.joomla.org/latest

	Copy the tar.gz file into a working directory eg

	$ cp JoomlaVx.x.x-Stable.tar.gz /tmp/Joomla

	Change to the working directory eg

	$ cd /tmp/Joomla

	Extract the files eg

	$ tar -zxvf JoomlaVx.x.x-Stable.tar.gz

	This will extract all the Joomla! files and directories.  Move the contents
	of that directory into a directory within your web server's document
	root or your public HTML directory eg

	$ mv /tmp/Joomla/* /var/www/html

	Alternatively if you downloaded the file to your computer and unpacked
	it locally use an FTP program to upload all files to your server.
	Make sure all PHP, HTML, CSS and JS files are sent in ASCII mode and
	image files (GIF, JPG, PNG) in BINARY mode.


2. CREATE THE Joomla! DATABASE

	Joomla! will currently work with MySQL, MSSQL and PostgreSQL but
	the following instructions are for MySQL. Refer to the relevant
	documentation if you are using another database.

	You can use your web control panel or phpMyAdmin to
	create a database for Joomla.

	Alternatively you can create a database with the CLI.
	In the following examples, "db_user" is an example MySQL user
	which has the CREATE and GRANT privileges. You will need to use
	the appropriate username for your system.

	First, you must create a new database for your Joomla! site eg

	$ mysqladmin -u db_user -p create Joomla

	MySQL will prompt for the 'db_user' database password and then create
	the initial database files. Next you must login and set the access
	database rights eg

	$ mysql -u db_user -p

	Again, you will be asked for the 'db_user' database password.  At the
	MySQL prompt, enter following command:

	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON Joomla.*
		TO nobody@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

	where:

	'Joomla' is the name of your database
	'nobody@localhost' is the userid of your web server MySQL account
	'password' is the password required to log in as the MySQL user

	If successful, MySQL will reply with

	Query OK, 0 rows affected

	to activate the new permissions you must enter the command

	flush privileges;

	and then enter 'exit' or 'quit' to exit MySQL.

3. WEB INSTALLER

Finally point your web browser to http://www.example.org where the Joomla! web
based installer will guide you through the rest of the installation.

4. CONFIGURE Joomla

You can now launch your browser and point it to your Joomla! site eg

	http://www.example.org -> Main Site
	http://www.example.org/administrator -> Admin

You can log into Admin using the username and password that you chose 
during the web based install.


Joomla! ADMINISTRATION
----------------------

Upon a new installation, your Joomla website defaults to a very basic
configuration with only a few active components, modules and templates.

Use Admin to install and configure additional extensions, add users, select
default language and much more.

Note that additional community contributed extensions and languages are
available at the Joomla! Extensions Directory (JED): https://extensions.joomla.org/

You can also install and use the `Install from Web Tab` to access the JED
directly from the Admin here:
http://www.example.org/administrator/index.php?option=com_installer&view=install
