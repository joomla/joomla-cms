Thereafter, the navigation will be the one defined for that language.<br />If the plugin <strong>'System - Language Filter'</strong> is unpublished, this may have unwanted results.<br /><strong>Method:</strong><br />1. Open Language Manager Content tab and make sure the Languages you want to use in contents are published and have a Language Code for the URL as well as prefix for the image used in the module display.<br />2. Create a Home page by assigning a language to a menu item and defining it as Default Home page for each published content language. <br />  3. Thereafter, you can assign a language to any Article, Category, Module, Newsfeed, Weblinks in Joomla.<br /> 4. Make sure the module and the plugin are published."
